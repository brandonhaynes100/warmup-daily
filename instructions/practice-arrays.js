// - Create an array of numbers, 1 through 10
// - Write a function, called forLoop that takes an array as a parameter, runs the array through a for(...) loop and does a console.log() of each element.
// - Write a function, called whileLoop that takes an array as a parameter, runs the array through a while(...) loop and does a console.log() of each element.
// - Implement .map(), .filter(), .reduce() as regular javascript functions that take in an array as a parameter, but do the same things as the real functions.
